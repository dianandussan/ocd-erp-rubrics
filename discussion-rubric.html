I need help with this assignment. You can find my IDD here: www.dianadussan.com/idd and you can find more information here: https://www.dianadussan.com/idt400x

Using the information in your Design Document, develop a Kirkpatrick Level I survey. Incorporate the course learning outcomes (CLOs) from your IDD to develop the questions that determine the success and alignment of your course. The survey may be created using any of the survey tools you were introduced to in this week's lecture, including the LMS you chose for your minicourse.
Important: If you embed the survey or use the LMS in your minicourse to create it, create a generic student login (example: GoshornIDT400xstudent) and a password that you will share in the discussion or peer review. Set the survey attempts to unlimited so multiple people can test your survey.
Survey requirements:
Length of survey - The survey must be a minimum of 10 questions.
Include an introduction at the top of the survey to encourage learner engagement and participation. You may want to reintroduce the course learning outcomes in this section if you plan to ask about learning outcome achievement in your survey questions.
Questions should be able to gauge how a participant feels or reacts to your minicourse.
Questions should be able to gauge how favorable, engaging, and relevant the minicourse was.
Use at least two different types of questions
Linear/Likert scales
Short answer for detailed feedback on something specific
Open-ended questions
Multiple answer questions
Ranking questions
Be creative!
I'll help you create a Kirkpatrick Level I survey for your minicourse. Let me first examine your Design Document and course information to understand your learning outcomes and course content.

The survey effectively measures learner reactions (Kirkpatrick Level I) by focusing on how participants felt about the course experience, their engagement levels, and their emotional responses to your innovative teaching methods for sensitive mental health content.

Would you like me to modify any questions or add additional elements to better serve your specific needs?

In one paragraph, reflect on your experience creating your Level 1 survey. How could you use the information you gather from this survey to improve the learning experience for future learners continually?
Include that although I've selected TalentLMS as my LMS for my Capstone Project, I decided to use Typeform to build it out because I was able to take my brainstorms made in a Google Doc and simply copy and paste them into Typeform all at once and it divided each question, including the Introduction and Ending notes, into their proper sections and required zero editing of questions and answers after copying and pasting it.

Creating this Level I survey was an enlightening experience that reinforced the importance of measuring learner reactions as the foundation for continuous improvement. The process of aligning survey questions with my course learning outcomes while ensuring they captured genuine emotional responses to sensitive mental health content required careful consideration of both pedagogical objectives and learner psychology. Although I've selected TalentLMS as my LMS for my Capstone Project, I decided to use Typeform to build out the survey because I was able to take my brainstorms made in a Google Doc and simply copy and paste them into Typeform all at once, and it divided each question, including the Introduction and Ending notes, into their proper sections and required zero editing of questions and answers after copying and pasting it. The data gathered from this survey will serve as a crucial feedback loop for iterative course improvements—positive reactions to gamification elements like the "OCD Monster" concept will validate innovative approaches, while lower engagement scores on specific activities will signal areas needing redesign. Most importantly, the open-ended responses about learners' emotional reactions to discussing OCD and ERP techniques will help me refine the balance between maintaining clinical accuracy and creating a supportive, non-intimidating learning environment. This continuous feedback cycle will enable me to enhance course relevance, adjust content delivery methods, and ensure that future iterations better meet the diverse needs of individuals and families affected by OCD.

More millenial professional female human voice less AI sounding.

Creating this Level I survey was honestly both exciting and nerve-wracking – I really wanted to capture authentic reactions to what can be pretty heavy mental health content without making it feel clinical or intimidating. The trickiest part was figuring out how to ask about learners' emotional responses to the gamification elements (like that OCD "Monster" concept) since I know that approach could either be brilliant or totally backfire depending on the person. Although I've selected TalentLMS as my LMS for my Capstone Project, I decided to use Typeform to build out the survey because I was able to take my brainstorms made in a Google Doc and simply copy and paste them into Typeform all at once, and it divided each question, including the Introduction and Ending notes, into their proper sections and required zero editing of questions and answers after copying and pasting it – which was honestly a game-changer for my workflow! The feedback I get from this survey is going to be gold for making real improvements. If people are loving the interactive scenarios but feeling overwhelmed by certain activities, I'll know exactly where to pivot. And those open-ended questions about their gut reactions? That's where I'll get the real insights about whether my approach to making OCD education more approachable actually lands the way I hope it does. I'm planning to use this data to constantly tweak things – maybe dial up the peer support elements if people crave more community, or simplify the gamification if it's coming across as trivializing rather than empowering. It's all about creating that sweet spot where people feel supported and engaged without feeling like they're being talked down to.

It was not nervewracking or exciting, it was fun to put these concepts to use because this is exaclty waht I'll be doing in the real world as an Instructional Designer soem day

Creating this Level I survey was genuinely fun because this is exactly the kind of work I'll be doing as an Instructional Designer in the real world – taking theoretical concepts like Kirkpatrick's evaluation model and actually putting them into practice with real learners and real outcomes at stake. It felt satisfying to move beyond just reading about survey design and actually craft questions that would give me actionable data about whether my gamification approach resonates or falls flat. Although I've selected TalentLMS as my LMS for my Capstone Project, I decided to use Typeform to build out the survey because I was able to take my brainstorms made in a Google Doc and simply copy and paste them into Typeform all at once, and it divided each question, including the Introduction and Ending notes, into their proper sections and required zero editing of questions and answers after copying and pasting it – which was honestly a game-changer for my workflow! The feedback I collect from this survey will be my roadmap for continuous improvement. If learners are responding positively to the branching scenarios but struggling with the discussion forums, I'll know to invest more time in community-building features. Those open-ended responses about their reactions to using gaming elements for serious mental health content will tell me whether I've struck the right tone or need to recalibrate. This is exactly the kind of iterative, data-driven approach I want to bring to corporate training environments – using learner feedback to constantly refine and enhance the experience rather than just launching something and hoping it works.

If I wanted to put the tech/app/platform I am using for each of my 4 evaluations and other parts of my IDD, what would be the best way to say that? For example, for this one, the answer would be Typeform.

Here are a few professional ways you could present this information:

Option 1: Simple format

Kirkpatrick Level I Survey: Typeform
Kirkpatrick Level II Assessment: [Platform name]
Kirkpatrick Level III Evaluation: [Platform name]
Kirkpatrick Level IV Analysis: [Platform name]
Option 2: More descriptive

Level I (Reaction) Survey Platform: Typeform
Level II (Learning) Assessment Tool: [Platform name]
Level III (Behavior) Evaluation Method: [Platform name]
Level IV (Results) Analysis Platform: [Platform name]
Option 3: In context Evaluation Technology Stack:

Reaction surveys delivered via Typeform
Learning assessments built in [platform]
Behavioral tracking through [platform]
ROI analysis conducted using [platform]
Option 4: Table format

Evaluation Level	Purpose	Platform/Tool
Level I	Learner Reactions	Typeform
Level II	Learning Assessment	[Platform]
Level III	Behavior Change	[Platform]
Level IV	Results/ROI	[Platform]
I'd recommend Option 2 since it's clear, professional, and shows you understand what each level measures while highlighting your tech choices. Which style feels most natural for your documentation?

Do this for Module 1 using the info from my IDD: Review your IDD and create a Kirkpatrick Level 2 assessment for one of the modules/lessons in your minicourse. Incorporate the course learning outcomes (CLOs) and module/lesson learning objectives from your IDD to develop the questions. The assessment may be created using any of the assessment creation tools you were introduced to in this week's lecture, including the LMS you have chosen for your minicourse.
In your portfolio, create a subtitle titled "Kirkpatrick Level 2" under the Week 3 section (400x) of your portfolio and insert the following information:

   * Module/lesson learning objective(s) the assessment is aligned with
   * Brief description of the learning materials and activities the learner will interact with as part of the module/lesson
   * Include a link to the assessment location.
      * Important: If you embed the assessment or use the LMS in your minicourse to create it, create a generic student login (example: GoshornIDT400xstudent) and a to-copy password that you will share in the discussion or peer review. Set the attempts to unlimited so that multiple people can test out your assessment.
   * Instructions for the assessment should include at least three of the following:
      * How much time do they have to complete it?
      * How many questions?
      * How many attempts per question or the entire assessment?
      * Total points the assessment is worth.
      * What grade is required to pass?
      * Can the assessment be taken on a mobile device?
      * If there are particular question types, such as matching or drag and drop, make sure there are instructions on how to complete them.
   * Length of assessment & Question Types - The assessment must be a minimum of 10 questions.
      * Use at least three different question types
         * Multiple-choice
         * True or False
         * Fill-in-the-Blank
         * Matching
         * Short Answer
         * Essay
         * Drag and drop
         * Other - be creative!
      * Include remediation (feedback) for correct and incorrect answers

In one paragraph, reflect on your experience creating your Level 2 survey. How could you use the information you gather from this assessment to continually improve the learning experience for future learners? Use the same tone and writing style that I use on dianadussan.com and resumegoat.com, my two websites.

Creating this Level 2 assessment was honestly such a practical learning experience because it forced me to think beyond just "did they like the content?" and really dig into "do they actually know this stuff now?" The process of aligning each question with specific learning objectives while making sure I was testing actual comprehension rather than just memorization really highlighted how intentional assessment design needs to be. Using Quizlet turned out to be a smart choice because the analytics will show me exactly which concepts students are consistently missing – if everyone's struggling with differentiating obsessions from compulsions, that's a clear signal I need to beef up that section with better examples or maybe add an interactive activity. The data I collect from this assessment becomes my roadmap for continuous improvement: low scores on scenario-based questions might mean I need more real-world examples in the content, while high performance on definitions but poor application scores could indicate I need to add more hands-on practice opportunities. What I love about this approach is that it takes the guesswork out of course iteration – instead of making changes based on gut feelings, I'll have concrete data showing me exactly where learners are succeeding and where they're hitting roadblocks, allowing me to make targeted improvements that actually move the needle on learning outcomes rather than just surface-level engagement.

Shorter please

Creating this Level 2 assessment was such a practical reality check because it forced me to move beyond "did they enjoy it?" to "do they actually get it now?" Using Quizlet's analytics will be game-changing – when I see students consistently bombing questions about differentiating obsessions from compulsions, that's my cue to add better examples or interactive activities to that section. The data becomes my improvement roadmap: if people nail the definitions but struggle with real-world scenarios, I know I need more hands-on practice opportunities. What I love about this approach is it eliminates the guesswork – instead of making changes based on hunches, I'll have concrete data showing exactly where learners succeed and where they hit walls, letting me make targeted tweaks that actually improve learning outcomes rather than just surface-level engagement.

Less wit, more to the point and less fluff. Include that Quizlet had some limitations, like I couldn't set a timer or even say how long it is expected to take

Creating this Level 2 assessment reinforced how critical it is to measure actual knowledge retention rather than just learner satisfaction. While Quizlet was effective for creating varied question types and providing immediate feedback, it had notable limitations – I couldn't set a timer for the assessment or even indicate expected completion time, which reduces my control over the testing environment. The real value will come from analyzing the performance data to identify specific knowledge gaps. If students consistently miss questions about differentiating obsessions from compulsions, that signals I need to strengthen that content area with better examples or additional practice. Low scores on scenario-based questions versus high scores on definitions would indicate I need more real-world application opportunities in the module. This data-driven approach eliminates guesswork and allows me to make targeted improvements based on concrete evidence of where students struggle, ultimately creating more effective learning experiences for future cohorts.

Mention that I selected Quizlet to expand my instructinoal design toolkit and add another tool under my belt and resume, but that I'm really looking forward to doing things within my chosen LMS soon.

Now, let's work on another thing. Check my IDD at www.dianadussan.com/idd and answer this... State the following items from your IDD for your chosen module/lesson:
* Course Learning Outcome(s) the assessment is aligned with
* Module/lesson learning objective(s) the assessment is aligned with
* Brief description of the learning materials and activities the learner will interact with as part of the module/lesson

Based on your IDD for Module 1: Demystifying the OCD Worry Monster, here are the alignment details:

Course Learning Outcome(s) the assessment is aligned with:
CLO #2: Articulate the Foundations of OCD

CLO #2.1: Define the key components of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
CLO #2.2: Differentiate between obsessions, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts using accurate terminology and examples
CLO #2.3: Identify, through real-life scenario analysis, the potential impact of OCD on various aspects of daily life (e.g., school, relationships, mood) with 80% accuracy
Module/lesson learning objective(s) the assessment is aligned with:
Weekly Learning Objectives (WLO) for Module 1:

Define the key terms "obsessions," "compulsions," and "intrusive thoughts" using accurate language and examples (aligns with CLO #2)
Differentiate between obsessions, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts based on their characteristics and impact (aligns with CLO #2)
Identify examples of obsessions, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts from real-life scenarios (aligns with CLO #2)
Brief description of the learning materials and activities the learner will interact with as part of the module/lesson:
Module 1 Learning Materials & Activities:

Video lectures explaining OCD fundamentals, terminology, and the different manifestations of OCD
Interactive content exploring how OCD can affect daily life, relationships, and overall well-being
In-Course Activity #1: "Different Faces of OCD" - A matching game where learners identify common OCD symptoms with specific types of the disorder
In-Course Activity #2: "Comic Strip Detective" - Learners analyze scenarios depicting different OCD types and their impact on daily life through visual storytelling
Discussion forum participation where learners can share insights and engage with peers about OCD awareness and understanding
Write a short 1-2 sentence intro to add to this

Here's a short intro for that section:

Module 1 Assessment Alignment Overview: This Kirkpatrick Level 2 assessment directly measures learner knowledge acquisition from Module 1, focusing on foundational OCD concepts and terminology essential for understanding Exposure Response Prevention therapy. The assessment aligns with specific course and module learning objectives to ensure students have mastered the prerequisite knowledge before advancing to ERP techniques.

Now let's do something else. Review my IDD again, but this time create a discussion and assignment prompt for one of the modules/lessons in your minicourse, preferably from one of the first 3 modules. Incorporate the course learning outcomes (CLOs) and module/lesson learning objectives from my IDD to develop the prompts. The assessment may be created using any of the discussion/assignment creation tools you were introduced to in this week's lecture, including the LMS you have chosen for your minicourse, which will be added to my minicourse in TalentLMS.

Each prompt can be uploaded individually to your TalentLMS course, giving you maximum flexibility in how you structure and time the activities within Module 2!

Now make a discussion prompt about Anxiety types. as outlined in my course with fear meters for chronic and acute anxiety in OCD?

Discussion Prompt: Understanding Chronic vs. Acute Anxiety in OCD
Document 
Perfect! I've created a discussion prompt specifically focused on the dual anxiety meter system from your course's gamification elements. Here's what makes this discussion effective:

Key Features:
✅ Directly addresses your course's anxiety meters: Chronic vs. Acute anxiety tracking ✅ Connects to gamification: Links to the OCD "Monster" vs. You scoring system ✅ Practical application: Students analyze their own anxiety patterns ✅ ERP preparation: Helps students understand why anxiety spikes during ERP (and why that's good!)

Learning Alignment:
CLO #4: Applying ERP techniques with understanding of anxiety responses
CLO #5: Using coping mechanisms during anxiety spikes
Course gamification: Reinforces why meters work the way they do
Discussion Structure:
🎯 Part 1: Students analyze their own "anxiety meters" and patterns 🎯 Part 2: Connect meter readings to ERP principles and the "anxiety paradox" 🎯 Part 3: Develop coping strategies for acute anxiety spikes

Why This Works:
Gamification Integration: Students understand why their "acute anxiety meter goes UP" when they're winning against the OCD Monster

Counterintuitive Learning: Prepares students for the reality that ERP success initially feels like failure (higher acute anxiety)

Personal Application: Students learn to "read" their own anxiety patterns using your course's framework

Community Support: Peer responses build the support network essential for ERP success

This discussion perfectly bridges the gap between your course's innovative gamification elements and the real psychological principles of ERP therapy!

Take my modified verison and shorten it so that it is less than 5000 characters. In our course, we use two anxiety meters to help you understand how OCD affects your anxiety levels:

• **Acute Anxiety Meter:** Shows the immediate spike in anxiety when you resist compulsions and face your fears (this goes UP when you use ERP techniques!)

• **Chronic Anxiety Meter:** Shows your overall, long-term anxiety levels that build up over time when OCD goes unchallenged

Understanding these two types of anxiety is crucial for successful ERP - because the goal is to accept SHORT-TERM increases in acute anxiety to achieve LONG-TERM decreases in chronic anxiety.
 
Your Mission (300-400 words):
Think about your own experience with anxiety (whether personal or observational) and discuss the following:
Part 1: Anxiety Meter Analysis (150-200 words)
1. Describe Your Meters: If you had anxiety meters right now, what would they show?
   * What's your current "chronic anxiety" baseline from ongoing OCD patterns?
   * When did you last experience "acute anxiety" from facing a fear or resisting a compulsion
2. Pattern Recognition: Describe a situation where you can see both types of anxiety:
   * How does avoiding compulsions affect your chronic anxiety over time?
   * What happens to your acute anxiety when you DO give in to compulsions?
Part 2: ERP Connection (100-150 words)
**3. The Anxiety Paradox: Explain why ERP might make your acute anxiety meter go UP initially (and why this is actually a good thing!)
4. Long-term Vision:** How do you think consistently facing fears (despite acute anxiety spikes) would affect your chronic anxiety meter over time?

Part 3: Coping Strategy (50-100 words)
**5. Managing the Spike:** What coping mechanisms could help you tolerate those acute anxiety spikes when using ERP techniques?

Discussion Guidelines:
* Use the "anxiety meter" metaphor throughout your response
* Be specific about anxiety patterns rather than general
* Share only what you're comfortable discussing
* Support classmates who share vulnerable experiences
* Connect your examples to ERP principles
Critical Thinking Questions to Consider:
* Why might people get discouraged when their acute anxiety spikes during ERP?
* How is short-term discomfort different from long-term suffering?
* What would happen to both meters if someone avoided all anxiety-provoking situations?
* How do these meters help explain why "safety behaviors" actually backfire?
 
Participation Requirements:
Initial Post:
* Word Count: 300-400 words
* Due Date: Wednesday by 11:59 PM
* Required Elements: Address all parts (meter analysis, ERP connection, coping strategy)
* 2 Peer Responses 

Discussion Prompt: Your Anxiety Meters - Chronic vs. Acute Anxiety
Document ∙ Version 2 
Perfect! ✅ The shortened discussion prompt is now 3,393 characters - well under the 5,000 character limit with 1,607 characters to spare.

What I Streamlined:
🎯 Removed: Lengthy rubric details, sample response starters, and extensive setup instructions 🎯 Kept: All essential elements from your modified version 🎯 Maintained: The complete anxiety meter explanation and all discussion requirements 🎯 Preserved: Clear structure, assessment criteria, and participation guidelines

Key Features Retained:
✅ Your exact anxiety meter descriptions (acute vs. chronic) ✅ Complete mission structure (Parts 1-3 with word counts) ✅ All discussion guidelines and critical thinking questions ✅ Full participation requirements (initial post + 2 peer responses) ✅ Assessment breakdown (50 points total)

The shortened version maintains all the pedagogical value while being much more concise for TalentLMS upload. Students get clear instructions without information overload, and you still have comprehensive assessment criteria built in.

This assignment now serves as a substantial Module 2.1 deliverable that creatively assesses ERP knowledge while maintaining academic rigor!

We need to create a Discussion Prompt for Module 3 following the same rules we did for the others, including the number of characters

Module 3 Discussion: Building Your ERP Fear Ladder
Document 
Perfect! ✅ The Module 3 discussion is 2,943 characters - well under the 5,000 limit with plenty of room to spare.

What Makes This Module 3 Discussion Effective:
✅ Connects to Module 3 activities: References the "Fear Ladder Builder" activity and 5-step ERP process from your IDD

✅ Aligns with CLO #4: Students practice applying ERP techniques and creating personalized exposure hierarchies

✅ Uses "ladder" metaphor: Consistent with Module 3's theme while making ERP concepts concrete and visual

✅ Practical application focus: Students create actual exposure hierarchies rather than just discussing theory

Key Learning Elements:
🎯 Part 1: Hands-on practice building 5-step exposure hierarchies with anxiety ratings (2-3/10 to 7-9/10)

🎯 Part 2: Strategic thinking about progression and ERP methodology - why gradual exposure works

🎯 Response Prevention Integration: Students must identify compulsions to resist at each ladder step

🎯 Real-world preparation: Discussion prepares students for actual ERP implementation

Assessment Focus:
Logical exposure hierarchy construction showing understanding of gradual progression
Accurate ERP terminology use (exposure hierarchy, response prevention, habituation)
Strategic reasoning about why steps are ordered and how they build on each other
Constructive peer feedback on methodology and ladder construction
This discussion perfectly bridges the gap between learning about ERP principles (Modules 1-2) and actually implementing them in real-world scenarios (Module 4), giving students hands-on practice with the core ERP tool: the fear ladder!

Make a short 1-2 sentence intro to introduce my IDD alignment on my portfolio as well as a reflection after it using these guidelines: In one paragraph, reflect on my experience creating my discussion and assignment prompts. How could you use the information you gather from these prompts to continually improve the learning experience for future learners?

IDD Alignment Introduction:
The following discussion prompts and assignments directly align with specific Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) and module learning objectives from my Instructional Design Document, ensuring each activity meaningfully contributes to students' mastery of OCD foundations and ERP techniques. This strategic alignment guarantees that every discussion and assignment serves a clear pedagogical purpose in building toward comprehensive ERP application skills.

[Insert your IDD alignment details here]

Reflection:
Creating these discussion prompts and assignments was incredibly practical because it forced me to think strategically about how each activity builds toward specific learning outcomes rather than just creating busy work. The real value will come from analyzing student performance data across these different assessment types - if students excel in discussions but struggle with individual assignments, that signals I need to strengthen the bridge between collaborative learning and independent application. What I found most valuable was designing activities that progressively build complexity, from foundational OCD terminology discussions to hands-on fear ladder construction, which mirrors how students will actually implement ERP in real life. The feedback I gather from these varied assessments will show me exactly where students hit roadblocks in their ERP understanding, allowing me to adjust content delivery, add more scaffolding activities, or redesign prompts that aren't generating the depth of engagement needed for successful anxiety management skill development.

Now make a reflection about making these rubrics and mention how I used Claude AI to transform the rubrics I created into a color coded table so that it was easier to understand than a huge long list. Make it 1 short paragraph

Creating these universal rubrics was a crucial step in ensuring consistent, fair assessment across my entire minicourse while maintaining clear expectations for students. The process of defining weighted criteria and performance levels forced me to think strategically about what truly matters in demonstrating OCD/ERP knowledge - balancing content mastery with critical thinking, participation, and professional communication skills. What made this particularly efficient was using Claude AI to transform my initial rubric drafts into color-coded HTML tables, which converted what would have been overwhelming text-heavy documents into visually clear, scannable formats that both students and I can quickly reference during assessment. This visual transformation not only makes the rubrics more user-friendly but also ensures that performance expectations are immediately apparent, reducing confusion and improving the overall learning experience while maintaining the academic rigor necessary for effective mental health education.

Reflection on Learning Theory:
In 250 words or less, reflect on the following questions:
Which learning theory (or theories) did you find most influential in shaping the design and objectives of your minicourse, and how did it guide your decisions regarding content, activities, and assessments? Update your IDD as necessary to reflect any shifts in your thinking and application of learning theory. 
Reflecting on the development of your minicourse, how did integrating principles from a specific learning theory enhance the learning experience for your target audience? Can you provide examples of how this theory influenced the instructional strategies or technologies you chose to use?
Reflection on Instructional Design Models:
In 250 words or less, reflect on the following questions:
Which instructional design model did you primarily follow in the development of your minicourse, and how did its specific phases or components influence the structure, content, and delivery methods of your course? Update your IDD as necessary to reflect any shifts in your thinking and application of instructional design models. 
Considering the instructional design model you applied, what were the most significant challenges and benefits you encountered in aligning your course design with this model? How did this model facilitate or hinder your ability to meet your learning objectives and address the needs of your learners? pening Presentation Screencast:
Criteria:
Create a 2 - 3 minute opening presentation screencast for one of the modules/units/lessons in your minicourse. We recommend you use the screencast you create in your actual minicourse to maximize your time and efficiency.
In your screencast, include 1 - 2 examples of course content that connect the learner to the upcoming work. Examples include showing where they'll review a video and then need to answer questions based on the video. 
Highlight engagement strategies in your content that will help ensure your learners are eager to go through the content.
Include closed captioning or a transcription file to be inclusive of all learners. 
Include the link on your portfolio or minicourse where your reflection and opening presentation screencast are located
Reflection on Learning Theory (250 words)
Social Learning Theory emerged as the most influential framework in shaping my OCD/ERP minicourse design, fundamentally guiding how I approached content delivery and community building. Bandura's emphasis on observational learning and self-efficacy perfectly aligned with my target audience's needs - people affected by OCD who often feel isolated and need to see that recovery is possible through others' experiences. This theory directly influenced my decision to integrate extensive discussion forums, peer support networks, and the "superhero" metaphor that allows learners to model successful ERP behaviors in a safe, encouraging environment.

The theory's focus on vicarious learning shaped my choice of branching scenarios and case studies where learners observe different approaches to ERP implementation, building confidence before attempting techniques themselves. Social Learning Theory also guided my assessment strategies - rather than purely individual evaluations, I incorporated peer responses and community engagement as core learning components, recognizing that mental health skill development thrives in supportive social contexts.

Additionally, I integrated elements of Constructivism through the fear ladder building activities, where learners actively construct their own understanding of anxiety management by creating personalized exposure hierarchies. The gamification elements (anxiety meters, OCD "Monster" scoring) reflect Social Learning Theory's emphasis on self-regulation and self-efficacy - learners track their progress and celebrate small victories, building confidence for real-world ERP application. This combination created a supportive learning environment where students learn both from expert content and from each other's experiences, essential for effective mental health education where hope and community support are therapeutic elements themselves.

Reflection on Instructional Design Models (250 words)
The ADDIE model provided the foundational framework for my minicourse development, with its systematic approach proving essential for addressing the complex needs of learners dealing with OCD. The Analysis phase was particularly crucial - conducting thorough learner analysis revealed that my audience needed both clinical accuracy and emotional support, leading to the integration of peer support forums and the careful balance between educational content and community building. This analysis directly influenced my decision to use TalentLMS with its discussion capabilities and mobile accessibility for anxiety management on-the-go.

The Design phase's emphasis on clear learning objectives helped me align every activity with specific CLOs, ensuring that even creative elements like the superhero assignments maintained pedagogical rigor. The Development phase benefited from ADDIE's iterative nature - I continuously refined content based on the model's feedback loops, leading to the dual anxiety meter gamification system that makes complex therapeutic concepts more accessible.

However, ADDIE's linear structure initially challenged my creative instincts for the mental health content. The model's systematic approach sometimes felt restrictive when designing empathetic, relationship-building activities. Yet this constraint ultimately strengthened the course by ensuring every supportive element also served clear learning outcomes. The Implementation and Evaluation phases will be crucial for this sensitive content - ADDIE's built-in assessment strategies help me plan for both learning measurement and emotional safety monitoring. The model's emphasis on continuous improvement aligns perfectly with the iterative nature of both instructional design and mental health treatment, where ongoing adjustment based on learner feedback is essential for success.

For the Opening Presentation Screencast, I would need to know which specific module you'd like me to create the presentation for, and what screen recording software you prefer to use. The screencast should:

Be 2-3 minutes long
Include 1-2 examples of upcoming course content
Highlight engagement strategies
Include closed captioning/transcription
Connect learners to their upcoming work

Is there a way to use AI to create a screencast of my minicourse?

While AI can't directly create screencasts of your actual minicourse, there are several AI-powered tools that can help you create screencast content more efficiently:

AI-Assisted Screencast Creation:
Script Generation:

Use AI (like Claude) to create detailed scripts for your screencast
Generate talking points, transitions, and explanations
Create closed caption text in advance
Voice Generation:

ElevenLabs or Murf for AI voiceovers if you prefer not to record your own voice
Speechify for text-to-speech conversion
Note: Your own voice will be more authentic for educational content
Visual Content Creation:

Canva AI for creating slide backgrounds and graphics
Midjourney/DALL-E for custom illustrations
Gamma for AI-generated presentation slides
Practical Approach for Your Module 2 Screencast:
What AI Can Help With:

Script refinement - I can polish the script I provided earlier
Slide content generation - Create bullet points and talking points
Visual descriptions - Suggest what to show on screen at each moment
What You'll Still Need to Do:

Record your screen using Loom (as planned)
Navigate through your actual TalentLMS course
Provide your authentic voice and personality
Demonstrate real course interactions
Limitations to Consider:
Authenticity Concerns:

Students expect to see the actual instructor
AI-generated content may feel impersonal for mental health topics
Your personal touch is valuable for building trust with OCD learners
Technical Limitations:

AI can't access your actual course platform
No AI tool can navigate TalentLMS and show real course features
Screen recording still requires human operation
Recommendation:
Stick with your original Loom plan for authenticity, but use AI to:

Perfect your script
Generate slide content if needed
Create supporting visuals
Develop closed captions after recording
The personal connection is especially important for mental health education, where students need to trust their instructor's expertise and empathy.

Multiple Choice (7 questions): Standard A/B/C/D format for core concepts Matching (3 questions): Connect definitions, types, and examples Fill in the Gaps (4 questions): Test specific terminology and understanding Ordering (1 question): Sequence the OCD cycle and impact progression

TalentLMS-Specific Features:
Assessment Configuration:

15 questions total with varied difficulty
25-minute time limit with 3 attempts allowed
70% passing threshold with immediate feedback
Question and answer randomization for integrity
Accessibility Compliance:

Screen reader compatibility
Extended time accommodations available
Keyboard navigation support
Alternative text for all elements
Learning Assessment Focus:
The assessment directly measures CLO #2 (Articulate OCD Foundations) through:

Terminology mastery via fill-in-the-gaps
Concept differentiation through multiple choice
Pattern recognition using matching exercises
Process understanding with ordering questions
Implementation Benefits:
Immediate Feedback: Each question provides specific, educational feedback regardless of answer Progressive Difficulty: Questions build from basic definitions to complex scenario analysis Comprehensive Coverage: Tests all key learning objectives from Module 1 Professional Standards: Meets assessment best practices for mental health education

The assessment balances rigor with accessibility, ensuring students can demonstrate their understanding of OCD foundations while receiving supportive feedback that reinforces learning rather than just measuring performance.

Rework fill in the gaps so the structure is exactly like this with possible answers in the brackets and divided by / as shown: 

Complete the following sentence: OCD affects approximately [70/seventy] million people worldwide, including over [3/three] million Americans.

Module 1 Assessment for TalentLMS - Multiple Question Types
Document ∙ Version 2 
Perfect! I've updated all four fill-in-the-gaps questions to follow your exact format with possible answers in brackets divided by forward slashes. Here's what I changed:

Updated Fill-in-the-Gaps Format:
Question 2: Complete the following sentence: OCD affects approximately [70/seventy] million people worldwide, including over [3/three] million Americans.

Question 7: Complete this definition: [Obsessions/obsessions] are recurrent, intrusive, and unwanted thoughts that cause significant [anxiety/distress/worry], while [compulsions/compulsions] are repetitive behaviors performed to reduce this feeling.

Question 11: Complete this statement about intrusive thoughts: Everyone experiences [intrusive/unwanted/random] thoughts, but they become [obsessions/obsessive/problematic] in OCD when they cause significant distress and lead to [compulsive/repetitive/ritual] behaviors.

Question 15: Complete this key insight about OCD treatment: Understanding the difference between [obsessions/obsessive thoughts], [compulsions/compulsive behaviors], and normal intrusive thoughts is the first step toward recognizing when [professional/evidence-based/therapeutic] treatment approaches like ERP therapy may be helpful.

Benefits of This Format:
Clear acceptable answers visible in the question itself
Multiple correct options allow for different learning styles and terminology preferences
TalentLMS compatibility with the bracket/slash format for auto-grading
Reduced confusion since students can see what answers are accepted
The assessment now maintains the same educational rigor while using the exact fill-in-the-gaps structure you specified for optimal TalentLMS implementation.

Come up with a message if the learner passed and one for if they didn't pass

Here are two supportive messages for your Module 1 assessment results:

Passing Message (70% or higher):
Congratulations! You've successfully completed Module 1.

You've demonstrated solid understanding of OCD foundations - the key building blocks you'll need for learning ERP techniques. Your grasp of the differences between obsessions, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts shows you're ready to move forward in your learning journey.

What's Next:

Continue to Module 2 where you'll discover how ERP can become your powerful tool against OCD
Remember that understanding these concepts is the first step toward empowerment
Keep building on this foundation as we explore practical ERP strategies
You're making real progress toward taking control of OCD patterns. Let's keep moving forward together.

Not Passing Message (Below 70%):
You're on the right track, but let's strengthen your foundation first.

Learning about OCD concepts takes time, and it's completely normal to need multiple attempts to master this material. The terminology and distinctions between obsessions, compulsions, and intrusive thoughts are crucial for understanding how ERP works, so let's make sure you have these basics solid.

What to do next:

Review the Module 1 content, especially the "Different Faces of OCD" and "Comic Strip Detective" activities
Focus on the key differences between thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions)
Take the assessment again when you feel ready - you have 2 more attempts
Remember: This is about building understanding, not perfect performance
Need Help?

Post questions in the discussion forum - your classmates and instructor are here to support you
Review the module videos again for reinforcement
Contact your instructor if you need additional clarification
Your willingness to learn about OCD management is already a significant step forward. Take your time getting these foundations right - they'll serve you well throughout the rest of the course.

Create A matrix or table for students for module 1, demonstrating the alignment of course activities, discussion, objectives, and assessments, allowing students to understand how the activities and assessments contribute to mastery of content.

Module 1 Learning Alignment Matrix
Document 
I've created a comprehensive learning alignment matrix for Module 1 that clearly demonstrates how each component contributes to student mastery. Here's what makes this matrix effective:

Key Features:
Clear Connections: Each activity explicitly links to specific CLOs and module learning objectives Learning Progression: Shows how activities build from foundation to application to integration Student-Centered Language: Explains "What You'll Do" and "How It Builds Mastery" in accessible terms Success Indicators: Concrete evidence students can use to gauge their own progress

Matrix Components:
Video Content → Foundation Building: Establishes essential vocabulary and concepts Interactive Activities → Application Practice: Develops pattern recognition and scenario analysis Discussion Forum → Integration: Synthesizes learning through peer interaction Assessment → Validation: Confirms readiness for advanced concepts

Student Benefits:
Transparency: Students understand why each activity matters for their learning Motivation: Clear connection between effort and mastery outcomes Self-Assessment: Success indicators help students monitor their own progress Preparation: Shows how Module 1 prepares them for ERP techniques in Module 2

Alignment with Capstone Requirements:
This matrix meets the rubric requirement for helping students understand how activities and assessments contribute to content mastery. It provides the transparency needed for effective learning while maintaining the supportive tone essential for mental health education.

The matrix can be posted in TalentLMS at the beginning of Module 1 to set clear expectations and help students approach their learning strategically.

What is a good title for this in the course navigation

Here are several effective navigation titles for this alignment matrix:

Short & Clear Options:

"Module 1 Learning Map"
"How Module 1 Works"
"Learning Alignment Guide"
More Descriptive Options:

"Module 1: Activities & Objectives"
"Your Learning Pathway"
"Understanding Module 1 Structure"
Student-Focused Options:

"How You'll Master Module 1"
"Your Module 1 Roadmap"
"What You'll Learn & How"
Recommended Choice: "Module 1 Learning Map"

This title is:

Concise for navigation menus
Descriptive without being wordy
Student-centered (implies guidance and direction)
Scannable in a course menu
Professional while remaining approachable
If you need something even shorter for tight navigation spaces, use "Learning Map" and it will be clear from context that it applies to Module 1.

What would be most understandable for a learner

For a learner, the most understandable title would be:

"How This Module Works"

This title is clearest because it:

Uses plain language without jargon ("learning map" or "alignment" may feel academic)
Answers an implicit question students have when starting a module
Sets expectations that they'll understand the structure
Feels approachable rather than formal or technical
Is immediately actionable - students know they'll find practical information
Alternative that's also very clear: "Module 1 Overview"

This works well because students are familiar with "overview" as a concept and know it means a summary of what to expect.

Why avoid:

"Learning Map" - metaphorical, requires interpretation
"Alignment Guide" - instructional design jargon
"Learning Pathway" - vague about actual content
For your OCD/ERP course specifically, where clarity and reducing anxiety are priorities, straightforward titles like "How This Module Works" help students feel oriented and confident about what they're about to encounter.

I have my modules set up as:
WEEK 1
Wk 1: Learning Objectives & Overview
Wk 1: Discussion
Wk 1: Assignment
Wk 1: Knowledge Check

What do you suggest I call Module 1? THe actual learning lesson?

Based on your structure, I'd suggest:

"Wk 1: Module Content"

or

"Wk 1: Core Learning"

This keeps your consistent "Wk 1:" prefix while clearly indicating this is where the actual teaching material lives (videos, readings, activities).

Other options that work well:

"Wk 1: Lesson" - Simple and clear
"Wk 1: Course Materials" - Broader, covers multiple content types
"Wk 1: Content & Activities" - Descriptive of what's inside
"Wk 1: Learn" - Very simple, action-oriented
Why these work:

Maintains your naming pattern
Students immediately know this contains the teaching content
Distinguishes it from the assessment/discussion components
Follows standard LMS conventions
My recommendation: "Wk 1: Module Content" because it clearly communicates that this section contains the learning materials while fitting your existing structure. Students will understand this is where they go to actually learn before doing the discussion, assignment, and knowledge check.

The progression then reads naturally:

Learning Objectives & Overview (what you'll learn)
Module Content (learn it)
Discussion (discuss it)
Assignment (apply it)
Knowledge Check (prove it)
Can you rework those 2 universal rubrics you made before so that they are 2 separate rubrics? Please include the embed html for both

Separate Universal Rubrics with HTML Embed Code
Code 
Perfect! I've created two separate, self-contained HTML rubrics with professional styling. Here's what you get:

Two Complete HTML Documents:
Rubric 1: Universal Discussion Rubric (50 points)

4 criteria: Content Knowledge (40%), Critical Thinking (25%), Participation (20%), Writing Mechanics (15%)
Color-coded performance levels
Complete scoring calculation guidelines
Rubric 2: Universal Assignment Rubric (100 points)

5 criteria: Content Mastery (35%), Critical Analysis (25%), Organization (20%), Professional Presentation (15%), Innovation (5%)
Same color-coding system for consistency
Detailed scoring guidelines
Key Features:
Professional Design:

Color-coded performance levels (green/yellow/red spectrum)
Clean table layout with clear hierarchy
Print-friendly styling
Mobile responsive
Easy Implementation:

Copy entire HTML for each rubric
Embed directly in TalentLMS HTML content blocks
Works as standalone web pages
Can be saved as separate files
How to Use:
Option 1: Separate HTML Files

Save discussion rubric as discussion-rubric.html
Save assignment rubric as assignment-rubric.html
Link from your course or embed
Option 2: Embed in TalentLMS

Copy the HTML for the discussion rubric div
Paste into TalentLMS HTML content block for discussions
Repeat for assignment rubric
Option 3: PDF Conversion

Open each HTML file in browser
Print to PDF (styling is print-optimized)
Upload PDFs to course documents
Each rubric is now completely independent and can be used, shared, or embedded separately while maintaining consistent professional standards across your entire minicourse!

Instead can you publish these separately to the web so I can have a link for them?

I can't directly publish HTML files to the web for you - I don't have the ability to host content on servers or create publicly accessible URLs.

However, here are several free options you can use to publish these rubrics and get shareable links:

Easy Free Hosting Options:
GitHub Pages (Recommended - Professional)

Create a free GitHub account
Create a new repository called "ocd-erp-rubrics"
Upload the HTML files
Enable GitHub Pages in settings
You'll get URLs like: https://yourusername.github.io/ocd-erp-rubrics/discussion-rubric.html
Google Drive

Upload HTML files to Google Drive
Right-click → Share → Get link
Set to "Anyone with the link can view"
Note: Displays as code, not rendered HTML (not ideal)
CodePen

Create free account at codepen.io
Create separate "pens" for each rubric
Get shareable URLs
HTML renders properly for viewing
Netlify Drop

Go to app.netlify.com/drop
Drag and drop your HTML files
Get instant public URL
Free, no account needed
Your Own Website (dianadussan.com) Since you already have a website, you could:

Upload the HTML files to your web host
Link them from your portfolio
URLs would be: dianadussan.com/discussion-rubric.html
My Recommendation:
Upload them to your existing website (dianadussan.com) since you're already showcasing your minicourse there. This keeps everything professional and centralized in your portfolio.

Would you like me to adjust the HTML formatting for any specific hosting platform, or help you create a simple instructions guide for uploading to your website?

I did Github steps 1-2 but where do I upload the HTML?

Here's how to upload HTML files to your GitHub repository:

Step 3: Upload Your HTML Files
Method 1: Direct Upload via GitHub Website (Easiest)

Go to your repository page on GitHub (you should see your "ocd-erp-rubrics" repo)
Click "Add file" button (near the top right)
Select "Upload files"
Drag and drop your two HTML files (or click "choose your files")
Scroll down and click the green "Commit changes" button
Method 2: Create Files Directly in GitHub

Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
Name it discussion-rubric.html
Copy and paste the discussion rubric HTML code into the editor
Scroll down and click "Commit new file"
Repeat for assignment-rubric.html
Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
Click "Settings" tab in your repository
Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar (or look for "GitHub Pages" section)
Under "Source", select "main" branch
Click "Save"
Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub to build your site
Refresh the page - you'll see a message with your site URL
Your Links Will Be:
Discussion Rubric: https://[your-username].github.io/ocd-erp-rubrics/discussion-rubric.html
Assignment Rubric: https://[your-username].github.io/ocd-erp-rubrics/assignment-rubric.html
Replace [your-username] with your actual GitHub username.

Tip: After uploading, it may take a few minutes for the pages to become accessible. If you get a 404 error initially, wait a few minutes and try again.

Need help with any of these steps?

It's been 10 minutes and I dont see it

Let's troubleshoot your GitHub Pages setup. Here are the most common issues:

Quick Checks:
1. Verify the exact URL format: The URL should be: https://[your-username].github.io/ocd-erp-rubrics/discussion-rubric.html

Make sure you're using:

Your actual GitHub username (not "your-username")
.github.io (not .github.com)
The exact filename including .html
2. Check GitHub Pages status:

Go to your repository Settings → Pages
Look for a green box that says "Your site is live at [URL]"
If it says anything else, GitHub Pages might not be enabled correctly
3. Common setup issues:

Is your repository public?

Go to Settings → scroll to bottom
If it says "Change repository visibility" and shows "Private", you need to make it public
GitHub Pages only works with public repos on free accounts
Is the branch set correctly?

Settings → Pages
Should show "main" or "master" branch selected
Should show "/ (root)" folder selected
Are the files in the right place?

Go to your repository main page
You should see discussion-rubric.html and assignment-rubric.html listed
If they're inside a folder, the URL needs to include that folder name
Try This:
Go to your repository main page
Click on discussion-rubric.html
Click the "Raw" button
Copy that URL - this is a direct link to your file (though not styled as nicely)
If that Raw link works, then the files are uploaded correctly and it's just a Pages configuration issue.

What do you see when you go to Settings → Pages? Is there a green success message or something else?

My file doesn't say .html

That's the issue! When you uploaded the file, GitHub didn't recognize it as an HTML file.

Fix This:
Option 1: Rename the file in GitHub

Click on the file in your repository
Click the pencil icon (Edit) at the top right
Change the filename at the top to include .html at the end
Scroll down and click "Commit changes"
Option 2: Delete and re-upload with correct name

Click on the file
Click the trash can icon to delete it
Go back to main repository page
Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
Name it discussion-rubric.html (make sure to include .html)
Paste the HTML code
Commit the file
Option 3: Upload again from your computer

Save the file on your computer as discussion-rubric.html (not just "discussion-rubric")
Make sure when you save it, the file type is set to "HTML" or "All files"
Re-upload to GitHub
Important:
The filename MUST end with .html for it to work as a webpage. Without the extension, GitHub treats it as a text file, not a webpage.

After you fix the filename, wait another 2-3 minutes and then try accessing: https://[your-username].github.io/ocd-erp-rubrics/discussion-rubric.html

Which option would you like to try?
